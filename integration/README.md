## Integration Tests

This was orginally meant to test the running binary. It is now a helper library for the integration-style unit tests in the root directory. You can still use this to bootstrap as outlined in the root ReadMe, however, the tests in this directory do not represent anything. They mearly bootstrap your developement.
